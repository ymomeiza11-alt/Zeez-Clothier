## [12.3.2] - 2025-07-29

### Changed

* Add coverage and complexity columns to class and method complexity tables

### Fixed

* [#1081](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage/issues/1081): Class complexity scatter chart tooltips show incorrect class

## [12.3.1] - 2025-06-18

### Changed

* Changed CSS for HTML report to not use common ligatures as this sometimes lead to hard-to-read code

## [12.3.0] - 2025-05-23

### Changed

* [#1080](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/php-code-coverage/pull/1080): Support for reporting code coverage information in OpenClover XML format; unlike the existing Clover XML reporter, which remains unchanged, the XML documents generated by this new reporter validate against the OpenClover project's XML schema definition, with one exception: we do not generate the `<testproject>` element. This feature is experimental and the generated XML might change in order to improve compliance with the OpenClover project's XML schema definition further. Such changes will be made in bugfix and/or minor releases even if they break backward compatibility.
